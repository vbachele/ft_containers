# FT_CONTAINERS
FT_CONTAINERS is a project from the 42 school in c++ with the goal:
- Recreate the container vector and its iterators
- Recreate the container stack
- Recreate the container map and its iterators

**In this project you will learn how to do the 3 stack**
*If you like it don't forget to put a star !*

## VECTOR

### How to do vector?
Begin by the beggining and read the [man](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/).
I'm using template inside my hpp document. All my functions are in the hpp doc
The project is divided into 5 parts:
- **Canonical form**
- **Iterators**
- **Capacity**
- **Element access**
- **Modifiers**

#### Canonical Form
You have to create constructor, that means you need to:
- **Declare your variables**
	- Your allocator for the allocation of the memory for your vector,
	- The size of the vector.
	- The capacity for your memory (You can have a buffer to improve performance for your machine)
	- A pointer to your vector.
- **Create the constructor functions**
	- Be sure you allocate the memory for your new vector.
- **Create the desctructor functions**
	- Be sure you free the memory allowed from your vector.
- **Create the assign content functions**
	- Be sure you free the memory from the vector which will be copied.
	- Be sure you allocate the memory from the memory allocated you are copying
